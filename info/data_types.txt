DATA TYPES
Mixed types of data in collumn is not allowed in sql. Simply, memory column shouldn't have "1.85" and "two fifty"
in rows, because if we want to fire some mathematical operation with these data, we'll fail on "two fifty".
When you creating table - you set data type for each column.

Numeric types:
INT (common), SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BIT.
String types:
CHAR, VARCHAR (common), BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB, TEXT, ENUM, SET. 
Date types:
DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR

INT - whole number, form -4294967295 to 4294967295
VARCHAR - 'variation characters' length. from 1 to 255 characters.

Each variable (int, or varchar) - still has set length. So that's why we need to check sometimes does the field
contain 100 chars, and doesn't contain 101.

DATA TYPES
Mixed types of data in collumn is not allowed in sql. Simply, memory column shouldn't have "1.85" and "two fifty"
in rows, because if we want to fire some mathematical operation with these data, we'll fail on "two fifty".
When you creating table - you set data type for each column.

Numeric types:
INT (common), SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BIT.
String types:
CHAR, VARCHAR (common), BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB, TEXT, ENUM, SET. 
Date types:
DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR

INT - whole number, form -4294967295 to 4294967295
VARCHAR - 'variation characters' length. from 1 to 255 characters.

Each variable (int, or varchar) - still has set length. So that's why we need to check sometimes does the field
contain 100 chars, and doesn't contain 101.

CHAR vs VARCHAR 
CHAR - has fixed length. So when CHAR(10) - that means if you insert 4 length string - mysql will add 6 spaces to this
value because CHAR has fixed length, if you add 11 length string - 1 character will be an error, or it will be chopped off.
When you are selecting that data back, spaces added by sql - removed. Char - mostly for short things, it's faster, like
sex, state, Yes/No flags.

VARCHAR - length is not fixed, means value stored exacly the same as you inserted, and uses less memory, since it doesn't
includes extra spaces. VARCHAR is slowier.

SELECT
* - means give me all the collumns from table.

Select expression - more complex query.
mysql$>select column_name1, column_name2 from table_name; - return only queried columns. Order of column is matter.

WHERE
WHERE clause specifies search conditions for the rows returned by the Query and limits rows to a meaningful set.
More specific selection. can be used with update, and delete.
mysql$>select * from table_name where column_name1 condition1 and condition2;
mysql$>select column_name1, column_name2 from table_name where column_name1 condition1 and condition2;

mysql$>select age, name from unic_cats where age=4 and name = 'Egg'; (or 'egg/EGG') -> by default case not matter
mysql$>select age, name from unic_cats where age=cat_id; (sql got that I want from unic_cats)
must be before group by.

alias
Selecting data and renaming column names to their to be more readable to you.
mysql$>SELECT age AS years, name as 'cat name' FROM unic_cats; (to use space in column name - use quotes '')
+-------+----------+
| years | cat name |
+-------+----------+
|     5 | Ringo    |
|     4 | Jackson  |
+-------+----------+
And you'll get 'years' and 'cat name' istead of age and name in column names.

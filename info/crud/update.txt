UPDATE
Update some data in tables.
UPDATE table_name SET column1='value1' where column2='value2'
find all rows with 'value2' in column2, and update for them column1 values to 'value1'

mysql$>update unic_cats set age=10 where cat_id=1;
Be aware that in safe mode updating allowed only by KEY (primary, foreign), so you need to use it. 

It's a good practice to first run SELECT rows that you want to update before fire the UPDATE query.

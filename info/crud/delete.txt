DELETE
drop database db_name;
drop table table_name;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM unic_cats WHERE name='Egg';

Also it's nice to type SELECT instead of DELETE to see what you're going to delete.
There is no undo button.

delete from table_name; - will delete all data from table, be careful.

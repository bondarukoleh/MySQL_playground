CREATE DATABASE your_name_db;

USE your_name_db - tell that we want to talk with some space on server.
SELECT database(); - see what db we are using right now.

TABLES
Relational database - is just a bunch of tables.
Tables hold the data. A collection of related data held in a struvctured format within a database.

Collums (headers)
        /       \
+------------+------------+
| host       | memory     | 
+------------+------------+
| localhost1 |  1.85      | <- row
+------------+------------+
| localhost2 |  2.50      | <- row
+------------+------------+

DATA TYPES
Mixed types of data in collumn is not allowed in sql. Simply, memory column shouldn't have "1.85" and "two fifty"
in rows, because if we want to fire some mathematical operation with these data, we'll fail on "two fifty".
When you creating table - you set data type for each column.

Numeric types:
INT (common), SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE, BIT.
String types:
CHAR, VARCHAR (common), BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB, TEXT, ENUM, SET. 
Date types:
DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR

INT - whole number, form -4294967295 to 4294967295
VARCHAR - 'variation characters' length. from 1 to 255 characters.

Each variable (int, or varchar) - still has set length. So that's why we need to check sometimes does the field
contain 100 chars, and doesn't contain 101.

Create table
CREATE table_name (column_name1 data_type, column_name2 data_type)
